3D models for Radar and Realsense Camera
========================================

Short variant should fit on printers with print volume 120mm x 120mm
However, the top holes are very close to the edge and might be fragile.

Models are created with Autodesk Fusion 360. STL files were generated with
"High refinement" defaults for convenience.

To print these models, only the STL files are needed. F3D files are included
should there be a need to modify these designs.

Additional Hardware Required
----------------------------

- 6x M3 15mm standoffs for Radar and RealSense Camera
- 6x M3 screws to secure standoffs to mount
- 1x 1/4-20 UNC nut for tripod mount, attach nut to base with glue
